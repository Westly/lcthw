Learn C the Hard way by Zed A. Shaw - http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/

With a busy work schedule, and raising a family, I will attempt to teach myself C in my spare time with the help of lcthw.

The only experience I have is building basic webpages / web apps in PHP, and MySQL. 

The comments you see will be my thoughts on what the code is ment to do / supposed to do.
